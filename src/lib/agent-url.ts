// THE SCOPE BASE IS A PREFIX (cinatra#2809, per-scope surfaces S3).
//
// Every vantage in the product — the workspace, a person's own scope, a
// project, a team, an organization — carries the same Agents surface, and a
// launch made from one of them belongs to it. So the agent routes are the SAME
// routes with the scope's own landing route in front: `/teams/<id>` +
// `/agents/<vendor>/<package>/<instance>`. A PREFIX, never a segment: the
// vendor/package/instance grammar below is untouched, which is why the bare
// `/agents/…` route stays exactly what it was and remains the global entry
// point.
//
// The base arrives as a plain string (`scopeSurfaceBase` in
// `src/lib/scope-surfaces.ts` mints it) rather than as a scope reference, so
// this leaf keeps its zero imports and the route graph gains no edge.
//
// `new` and `settings` are RESERVED below the vendor/package pair: the first is
// the launcher (a fresh run), the second the agent's settings surface at this
// scope. The reservation is on the segment AFTER the pair and nowhere else — a
// package genuinely named `new` addresses fine, because its name is the pair's
// second half, not the instance slot.
