/**
 * The generic artifact-review SURFACE MODEL (cinatra#1795, epic #1620 S12,
 * item 4). The PURE presentation logic behind the host decision chrome —
 * type-agnostic, keyed on NO concrete artifact type / binding / renderer id
 * (G1-clean): it branches only on the OPAQUE host mount kind + the closed
 * blocked/permission axes. Every seam here is plain data, so the whole
 * §I–VI display+decide matrix is unit-testable without React or a DB.
 *
 * Ratified design spec `specs/app-artifact-review.html`
 * @ design@30a0f9c9 (owner-approved). This module owns the spec's derived,
 * non-visual mappings (provenance chip class, blocked/permission copy, the
 * per-mount conformance anchor) so the surface components stay thin.
 *
 * BOUNDARY (epic #1620 ADR): the generic surface is display + DECIDE only. No
 * type-owned field renderer, no edit affordance, no renderer-id path — the
 * renderer identity is host-resolved from the artifact TYPE upstream and reaches
 * this model only as the opaque `ReviewTargetMount` kind.
