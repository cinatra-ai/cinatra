// Fixture tests for the CHAT-HITL PROGRAM ACCEPTANCE gate (cinatra#2573, epic
// #2564 S7).
//
// This gate is the program's Done-definition made mechanical, so the failure it
// must never have is a manifest that LOOKS green. The tests hold that from both
// sides:
//
//   1. HONESTY. A row whose named proof does not exist FAILS — for a MISSING
//      row exactly as for a MAPPED one, because a MISSING row routinely carries
//      the proofs of the clauses that ARE met and a stale reference there is
//      just as misleading. A row that drifts from the issue's wording, is out of
//      order, is duplicated, or claims a disposition with no proof, also fails.
//   2. STRICTNESS MEANS DONE. `--strict` reports NOT READY for a manifest with
//      MISSING or partial rows — it is not satisfied by "no false claim found".
//      An all-red manifest is the case that must never read as clean.
//   3. THE REAL MANIFEST is honest right now: audit passes, every referenced
//      test really exists, and strict reports the program NOT READY — two
//      criteria MISSING and one partial, each naming what is absent.
//
//      That last expectation has now been inverted twice, and each inversion is
//      recorded where it happened. It asserted NOT READY by design so that no
//      lane could flip a row green in passing; the finisher round (2026-08-13)
//      flipped it to READY once the two defects it found had landed on main and
//      the owner had ruled. A code-grounded audit then showed the flip was
//      wrong on two rows: the schedule criterion was mapped onto tests that
//      never draw a card, and the conformance matrix was recorded ready with no
//      cells at all on two of its four cards. It reads NOT READY again, and it
//      goes green when those cards are DRAWN — never when they are re-read.
